description: "This colour changing LED cylinder from eLEDglance is a waterproof outdoor or indoor furniture item to transform your garden or a room into a beautifully lit space! Use it to sit on or a small table to keep your drinks on. It will be the talking point of your Party!  Eye-catching and inspiring, this illuminated contemporary furniture will brighten up any relaxing space and add an atmospheric extra dimension to your entertaining! Not only can this be used as a stool, but a side table, foot rest, or simply as a futuristic light feature!  It has comfy rounded edges and a series of clever LED's discreetly fitted inside which are controlled by remote control.  The great thing about this furniture is that the LED lights are run by a rechargeable battery, so if you don't want to power it from the mains you can go wireless!  The rechargeable battery inside the stool will give you a good eight hours of lighting without any trailing wires. When it runs out of juice, just plug it back into the mains with the supplied induction charger!"
